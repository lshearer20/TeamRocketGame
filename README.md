# INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROJECT SETUP
# 
# REPO SETUP:
# Clone the repo to your local computer and branch off of master. Call if <yourname_D#> with the number of the current active milestone as the number in the name.
# This naming convention will make it easier to track branches throughout the project.
#
# MONOGAME SETUP:
# To download Monogame, go to http://www.monogame.net/downloads/ and download the latest version for Visual Studio.
# Once downloaded, run the installer. Default options should be fine.
# Note: Monogame is not available for VS 2019. VS 2015 or VS 2017 should work.
